## Enum Parsing Implementation

### User Types
```typescript
USER_TYPES = {
  MEMBER: 0,        // Regular member
  GOVERNOR: 1,      // Governor with admin privileges  
  DAO_CREATOR: 2    // Creator with full control
}
```

### Proposal Status
```typescript
PROPOSAL_STATUS = {
  PENDING: 0,       // Waiting to start
  ACTIVE: 1,        // Currently accepting votes
  PASSED: 2,        // Proposal passed
  REJECTED: 3,      // Proposal rejected
  EXECUTED: 4,      // Proposal executed
  CANCELED: 5       // Proposal canceled
}
```

### Task Status  
```typescript
TASK_STATUS = {
  OPEN: 0,          // Available for assignment
  IN_PROGRESS: 1,   // Currently being worked on
  COMPLETED: 2,     // Task completed
  CANCELED: 3       // Task canceled
}
```

### Vote Types
```typescript
VOTE_TYPES = {
  FOR: 0,           // Vote in favor
  AGAINST: 1,       // Vote against
  ABSTAIN: 2        // Abstain from voting
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# Smart Contract Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODULE_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODULE_NAME=contracts  
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESS=your_admin_wallet_address

# Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_URL=https://api.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1
```

### 2. Contract Deployment

Ensure your smart contract is deployed and initialized:

1. Deploy the contract to Aptos devnet
2. Initialize the platform using the admin account
3. Update the environment variables with correct addresses

### 3. User Registration

Users must be registered in the system:
- Join a DAO using invite codes
- Get promoted to governor by DAO creator
- Creators automatically get access when creating DAOs

## Dashboard Sections

## Usage Examples

### Promoting a Member to Governor
1. Connect as DAO Creator
2. Navigate to "Promote to Governor" section
3. Enter member's wallet address
4. Click "Promote" button
5. Confirm transaction in wallet
6. Wait for blockchain confirmation

### Generating Invite Links
1. Connect as Creator or Governor
2. Click "Generate Invite Link" 
3. Copy the generated link
4. Share with potential members
5. Members can join using the link

### Monitoring Proposals
1. View proposals in the Proposals section
2. Check status using color-coded badges:
   - üü° Pending - Not yet started
   - üü¢ Active - Currently voting
   - üîµ Passed - Proposal successful
   - üî¥ Rejected - Proposal failed
   - üü£ Executed - Changes implemented
   - ‚ö´ Canceled - Proposal canceled

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Access Denied" Error
- **Cause**: User doesn't have Governor or Creator role
- **Solution**: Get promoted by DAO Creator or create your own DAO

#### "Error Loading Data" 
- **Cause**: Network connection or contract issues
- **Solution**: Check wallet connection and network status

#### Transaction Failures
- **Cause**: Insufficient gas, invalid parameters, or network issues
- **Solution**: Check gas balance, verify addresses, try again

#### Empty Data Sections
- **Cause**: DAO might not have proposals/tasks yet
- **Solution**: This is normal for new DAOs

### Getting Help

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all contract addresses are correct
2. **Verify Network**: Confirm you're on the right Aptos network
3. **Check Wallet**: Ensure wallet is connected and has sufficient gas
4. **Smart Contract Status**: Verify contract is deployed and initialized
